Sample Database Analysis of a fictious movie rental company using PostgreSQL with purpose of learning SQL as part of Careerfoundry Data Analysis course. 
# Objectives
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictious movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the company is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. I used SQL to analyze the data and to provide data-driven insights.
